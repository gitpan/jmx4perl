=head1 NAME

JMX::Jmx4Perl::Agent::Protocol - j4p-agent protocol specification 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document defines the protocol format for exchanging informations between
the Java-Agent C<j4p-agent.war> running in a Java Application Server and the
Perl module L<JMX::Jmx4Perl::Agent> which is used on the client side. The
communication is based on HTTP as the transport protocol and hence follows a
request-response paradigmn. The request is performed by doing a simple restfule
GET HTTP request where the request information is part of the URL itself. The
response returned by the agent uses JSON for the data representation. Both, the
request URL format and the JSON format of the response are described below.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Version 0.1 of the j4p-agent protocol. This is the
initial version. 

=head1 REQUEST 

Jmx4perl uses a restful style for the request, which essentially is a single URL
without additional parameters for specifying the request. For this to work, the
URL is divided into parts separated by C</>. In general, the request URL looks
like

 <base-url>/<mode of operation>/<operation specific parameter>/..../

The I<C<E<lt>base-urlE<gt>>> specifies the URL under which the C<j4p-agent> is
accessible in general. It typically looks like
F<http://localhost:8080/j4p-agent>, but depends obviously on your deployment
setup. Normally, the last part of this URL is the name of the deployed
Webapplication, which by default is based on the filename F<j4p-agent.war>.
I<C<E<lt>mode of operationE<gt>>> specifies one of the supported operations
after which operation specific parameters follow.

The supported operations are described now in the following sections. 

=head2 read

Mode used for reading an JMX attributes. The operation specific parameters have
the following format.

  <mbean name>/<attribute name>/<inner path>

=over

=item C<mbean name> (mandatory)

The canonical name of the MBean for which the attribute should be
fetched. Please refer to the JMX documentation for the definition of a
B<canonical name>. In short, it contains two parts: A domain part and a list of
properties which are separated by C<:>. Properties themselves are combines
in a comma separated list of key-value pairs.

Example:

 java.lang:type=Memory
 java.lang:name=Code Cache,type=MemoryPool

=item C<attribute name> (mandatory)

This is the name of the attribute which is requested. 

Example:

 HeapMemoryUsage
 SystemProperties

=item C<inner path> (optional)

This is an optional part which specifies an inner path within the attribute's
type. j4p-agent knows how to serialize certain complex data types with JSON,
i.e. collections and C<CompoundData>. Please refer to the next section for more
details about JSON serialization. An I<inner path> can be used to specify a
certain substructure (plain value, array, hash) within the returned complex
attribute value. Think of it as something like "XPath lite". This is best
explained by an example:

The attribute C<HeapMemoryUsage> of the MBean C<java.lang:type=Memory> can be
requested with the URL 

  http://localhost:8080/j4p-agent/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage

which returns a complex JSON structure like

 {
   "committed" : 18292736,
   "used" : 15348352,
   "max" => 532742144,
   "init" => 0
 }

In order to get to the value for used heap memory you should specify an inner
path C<used>, so that the request 

 http://localhost:8080/j4p-agent/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage/used

results in a response of
  
 15348352

If the attribute contains arrays at some level, use a numeric index as part of
the innerpath if you want to transverse into this array. 

=back

=head2 list

The list operation allows you to get information about the accessible
MBeans. This information includes the MBean names, their attributes and
operations along with type information and description (as far as they are
provided by the MBean author which doesn't seem to be often the case). 

A list-request can take these specific, optional,  parameters

  <inner path>

=over

=item C<inner path> (optional)

The I<inner path>, as above, specifies a subset of the complete response. You
can use this to select a specific domain, MBean or attribute/operation. See
below for the format of the complete answer. 

=back 

=head2 Escaping

If you are forced to use a slash (C</>) as part of your request (e.g. as part
of you bean's name) you need to escape it. A single slash (C</>) is escaped by
the combination C</-/>, two subsequent slashes (C<//>) are to be escaped with
C</--/> and so on. For example, to request the atrribute C<State> on the MBean
named C<jboss.jmx:alias=jmx/rmi/RMIAdaptor>, you should an URL like

  .../read/jboss.jmx:alias=jmx/-/rmi/-/RMIAdaptor/State

L<JMX::Jmx4Perl::Agent> does this sort of escaping transparently.

=head1 RESPONSE

As already mentioned, the response is an HTTP response containing a JSON
payload. This section describes the format of the retuned answer, depending on
the operation mode. In general, two kinds of responses can be classified: In
the normal case, a HTTP Response with response code 200 is returned, containing
the result of the operation as a JSON payload. In case of an error, a 4xx or
5xx code will be returned and the JSON payload contains details about the error
occured.

In the non-error case, the top-level JSON response objects contains a C<value>,
a C<status> of 200 and a C<request>, which encapsulated the original
request. This C<request> has as members a C<type> member for the operational
mode ("read", "list", ...) and additional entries containing the operation
specific parameters as given in the request URL. 

=head2 read

A typical response for an attribute read operation for an URL like 

 http://localhost:8080/j4p-agent/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage/

looks like 

 {
   "value":{
             "init":134217728,
             "max":532742144,
             "committed":133365760,
             "used":19046472
           },
   "status":200,
   "request":{
               "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
               "type":"read",
               "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage"
             }
 }

As you can see, the C<value> contains the attribute's value, either as a
single, simple value if the attribute has a primitive type, or a complex JSON
structure (containing maps and arrays) if the attribute has a more complex type
understood by the F<j4p-agent>. For comlext object types, which can not be
serialized by the F<j4p-agent>, the stringified value (i.e. the output of the
object's C<toString()> method) is returned here. For a successul request the
C<status> is always C<200>. The C<request>'s attribute are:

=over

=item mbean

name of the requested MBean

=item attribute

attribute name

=item type 

is always C<read>

=item path 

an optional path, if provided in the request.

=back

=head2 list

The list operation (without a I<path>) returns a JSON object containing a
C<value>, C<status> and C<request> member as for C<read> operations. 

The C<value> has the following format:
  
 { 
  <domain> : 
  {
    <prop list> : 
    {
      "attr" : 
      {
        <attr name> : 
        { 
          "type" : <attribute type>,
          "desc" : <textual description of attribute>,
          "rw"   : true/false
        },
        ....
      }, 
      "op" :
      {
         <operation name> :
         {
           "args" : [
                      { 
                       "type" : <argument type>
                       "name" : <argument name>
                       "desc" : <textual description of argument>
                      },
                      .....
                     ],
           "ret"  : <return type>,
           "desc" : <textual description of operation>
         }, 
         .....
      }
    }, 
    ....
  },
  ....
 }

The C<domain name> and the C<property list> together uniquely identify a single
MBean. The property list is in the so called I<canonical order>, i.e. in the
form "<key1>=<val1>,<key2>=<val2>,.." where the keys are ordered
alphabetically. Each MBean has zero or more attributes and operations which can
be reaced in an MBeans JSON object with the keys C<attr> and C<op>
respectively. Within these groups the contained information is explained above
in the schema and consist of Java types for attributes, arguments and return
values, descriptive information and whether an attribute is writable (C<rw ==
true>) or read-only. 

As for reading attributes you can fetch a subset of this information using an
path. E.g a path of C<domain/prop-list> would return the value for a single
bean only. For example, a request 

 http://localhost:8080/j4p-agent/list/java.lang/type=Memory

results in an answer

 {
   "value":
   { 
     "op":
     { 
       "gc":
       {
         "args":[],
         "ret":"void",
         "desc":"gc"
       }
     },
     "attr":
     {
       "NonHeapMemoryUsage":
       {
         "type":"javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
         "rw":false,
         "desc":"NonHeapMemoryUsage"
       },
       "Verbose":
       {
         "type":"boolean",
         "rw":true,
         "desc":"Verbose"
       },
       "HeapMemoryUsage":
       {
         "type":"javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
         "rw":false,
         "desc":"HeapMemoryUsage"
       },
       "ObjectPendingFinalizationCount":
       {
         "type":"int",
         "rw":false,
         "desc":"ObjectPendingFinalizationCount"
       }
     }
   },
   "status":200,
   "request":
   {
     "type":"list",
     "path":"java.lang\/type=Memory"
   }
 }

=head2 Error Response

An error response looks like

  {
    "status":400,
    "error":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid request type 'java.lang:type=Memory'",
    "stacktrace":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid request type 'java.lang:type=Memory'\n
                  \tat org.cpan.jmx4perl.JmxRequest.extractType(Unknown Source)\n
                  \tat org.cpan.jmx4perl.JmxRequest.<init>(Unknown Source) ...."
  } 

I.e. the C<status> has a code in the range C<400 .. 499> or C<500 .. 599> as it
is specified for HTTP return codes. The C<error> member contains an error
description while C<stacktrace> contains a Java stacktrace occured on the
server side (if any).
