                               ========

INTRODUCTION

  jmx4perl provides a new way for accessing Java JEE Server management
  interfaces which are based on JMX (Java Management Extensions). It
  is an agent based approach, where a small Java Webapplication (<30k)
  deployed on the application server provides a an HTTP/JSON based
  access to the JMX MBeans registered within the application server.  

  A discussion about the pros and cons of an agent based vs. a direct
  JMX remoting (which is available via JSR 160 connectors) can be
  found in the man page "jmx4perl" contained within this package. The
  biggest advantage for an agent based approach is that no local java
  installation is required for using it.

  There a future plans for providing a JSR 160 based access as
  well. Stay tuned ...

HOW IT WORKS

  You need to deploy a small (<30k) Java Agent WAR (web archive) to
  the Java application server to monitor. Thats all on the java
  side. There is no need to add any startup parameters to the
  application server and to open any additional ports. All
  communication takes places via HTTP where JSON objects are
  exchanged. Additionally, the agent benefits from the security
  infrastructure in place which every application server provides for
  web application.

  The Perl module JMX::Jmx4Perl::Agent accesses this web application
  and transform the request's results from JSON into a simple pure
  Perl object. This distribution contains a sample Nagios check
  'check_jmx4perl' which use this result to perform various checks.

INSTALLATION

  The Perl part installs as any other module via Module::Build, which
  you need to have installed. Using

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

  will install the modules (sorry, no tests yet). If you have Java
  and "ant" (a Java build tool) installed, the Java agent will be
  compiled and packaged as well. However, this is not required. A
  precompile "j4p-agent.war" can be found in the "agent" directory. 

  For the module to work, you need to deploy "j4p-agent.war" to the
  JEE Server to monitor. The concrete steps depend on the specific way
  for deploying on the targeted server, which in most cases is a
  simple copying in to a specific directory. Please consult the
  documentation of your Java application server for the details (look
  for "deployment" and "war")

  (TODO: Detailed deployment instructions for supported platforms)

  To test it, you can use 'check_jmx4perl' which gets installed as
  well. Consult its documentation for further details. 
  
SUPPORTED APPLICATION SERVERS
  
  For now, the following Java Application Servers has been tested:

  * JBoss 4
  * Weblogic 10 
  * Glassfish 2
  * Tomcat 5
  * Jetty 6

  There is work underway to extend this list. However, it is expected
  that every Java application server which runs with at least Java 1.5
  and conforms to at least version 2.4 of the Servlet specification
  should work.
